# Sitepo-8
A (Si)mple (Te)st (P)r(o)ject to familiarise myself with fantasy console development, using Love2d

The sitepo-8 is an 8bit fantasy console that is very minimalistic and not actually meant for use (unless you like, want to, then go for it lol). More details can be found in the wiki.

Feel free to inspect, disect, and modify the code here. Just no promises that it's very good.
